# Rust Best Practices

Comprehensive guide for writing high-quality, idiomatic, and highly optimized Rust code. Contains 272 rules across 27 categories, prioritized by impact to guide LLMs in code generation and refactoring. Current for Rust 1.98.1 (2024 edition).

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:

- Writing new Rust functions, structs, or modules
- Implementing error handling or async code
- Writing concurrent, parallel, or `unsafe` code
- Designing public APIs for libraries
- Reviewing code for ownership/borrowing issues
- Optimizing memory usage or reducing allocations
- Tuning performance for hot paths
- Refactoring existing Rust code

## Release Profile Guidance

### Recommended Cargo.toml Settings

```toml
[profile.release]
opt-level = 3
lto = "fat"
codegen-units = 1
panic = "abort"
strip = true

[profile.bench]
inherits = "release"
debug = true
strip = false

[profile.dev]
opt-level = 0
debug = true

[profile.dev.package."*"]
opt-level = 3  # Optimize dependencies in dev
```

Cargo's defaults are the starting point, not a defect to replace with one
universal profile. Select LTO, codegen-unit count, debug information, stripping,
and panic strategy according to measured runtime/build-time results and the
deployment's diagnostic and failure-semantics requirements. See
[`perf-release-profile`](rules/perf-release-profile.md),
[`opt-lto-release`](rules/opt-lto-release.md), and
[`opt-codegen-units`](rules/opt-codegen-units.md).

## How to Use

This skill provides rule identifiers for quick reference. When generating or reviewing Rust code:

1. **Check relevant category** based on task type
2. **Apply rules** with matching prefix
3. **Prioritize** CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW
4. **Read rule files** in `rules/` for detailed examples

### Rule Application by Task

| Task                      | Primary Categories                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| New function              | `own-`, `err-`, `name-`, `pat-`       |
| New struct/API            | `api-`, `type-`, `conv-`, `doc-`      |
| Async code                | `async-`, `own-`                      |
| Concurrency / parallelism | `conc-`, `async-`, `own-`             |
| Unsafe code               | `unsafe-`, `type-`, `test-`           |
| Error handling            | `err-`, `api-`, `pat-`                |
| Security / resilience     | `security-`, `err-`, `async-`, `obs-` |
| Type conversions          | `conv-`, `api-`                       |
| Serialization (serde)     | `serde-`, `type-`, `api-`             |
| Numeric / arithmetic      | `num-`, `type-`                       |
| Traits / generics         | `trait-`, `api-`, `type-`, `own-`     |
| Const / compile-time      | `const-`, `type-`, `opt-`             |
| Macros / code generation  | `macro-`, `anti-`                     |
| Closures / callbacks      | `closure-`, `type-`                   |
| Collections               | `coll-`, `mem-`, `perf-`, `own-`      |
| Logging / observability   | `obs-`, `err-`                        |
| Memory optimization       | `mem-`, `own-`, `perf-`               |
| Performance tuning        | `opt-`, `mem-`, `perf-`               |
| Project / workspace       | `proj-`, `doc-`, `lint-`              |
| Code review               | `anti-`, `lint-`                      |
