# closure-static-vs-dyn

> Accept `impl Fn` (generic) for hot callbacks; use `&dyn Fn`/`Box<dyn Fn>` to cut code size or to store them

## Why It Matters

A generic parameter `F: Fn(…) -> …` (or `impl Fn`) uses static dispatch and
is monomorphized for each concrete callback type that is instantiated. That
enables inlining, but many callback types can increase code size. `&dyn Fn` and
`Box<dyn Fn>` use vtable dispatch, allowing one non-generic function body to
accept different callback types and allowing heterogeneous callbacks to be
stored behind pointers. Choose by ownership, storage, and measured trade-offs.

## Bad

```rust
// Storing closures generically in a struct is impossible — the struct
// would need a type parameter per handler, making it unusable.
struct BadRegistry<F: Fn(&str)> {
    // Can only hold ONE concrete closure type — defeats the purpose.
    handler: F,
}

// Equally, using Box<dyn Fn> on a hot, single-call-site inner loop
// pays a vtable cost for no benefit.
fn transform_slow(xs: &[i32], f: &dyn Fn(i32) -> i32) -> Vec<i32> {
    xs.iter().map(|&x| f(x)).collect()
}
```

## Good

```rust
// Generic / static dispatch: preferred for hot paths — inlinable, zero allocation.
fn transform<F: Fn(i32) -> i32>(xs: &[i32], f: F) -> Vec<i32> {
    xs.iter().map(|&x| f(x)).collect()
}

// Dynamic dispatch: required when storing heterogeneous closures.
struct Registry {
    handlers: Vec<Box<dyn Fn(&str)>>,
}

impl Registry {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self { handlers: Vec::new() }
    }

    fn register(&mut self, handler: impl Fn(&str) + 'static) {
        self.handlers.push(Box::new(handler));
    }

    fn dispatch(&self, event: &str) {
        for handler in &self.handlers {
            handler(event);
        }
    }
}

fn demo() {
    // Static dispatch — the compiler may inline the closure entirely.
    let doubled = transform(&[1, 2, 3], |x| x * 2);
    assert_eq!(doubled, vec![2, 4, 6]);

    // Dynamic dispatch and heterogeneous stored handlers.
    let mut reg = Registry::new();
    reg.register(|e| println!("logger: {e}"));
    reg.register(|e| println!("metrics: {e}"));
    reg.dispatch("user_signup");
}
```

## Decision Table

| Situation                                | Use                                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Hot inner loop, single call site         | `impl Fn` / generic `F: Fn`                   |
| Callback stored in a struct field        | `Box<dyn Fn>`                                 |
| Collection of mixed closures             | `Vec<Box<dyn Fn(…)>>`                         |
| Pass-through, one level deep, not stored | `&dyn Fn` (avoids allocation)                 |
| Owned by a `Send` future across `.await` | `Box<dyn Fn() + Send>` (add `Sync` if shared) |

**Note:** `&dyn Fn` is useful to avoid an allocation when you only need to borrow the closure for one call and do not store it. Pass `&closure` (reference to a stack-allocated closure) rather than boxing.

```rust
fn call_once_dyn(f: &dyn Fn() -> i32) -> i32 {
    f()
}

fn demo_ref() {
    let x = 7;
    let result = call_once_dyn(&|| x + 1);
    assert_eq!(result, 8);
}
```
